        <h4 style = "font-size:25px">Car Detection </h4>
        <p style = "font-size: 20px;"> I built a car detection system using a Raspberry Pi. First, I gathered data and trained a 
            model that would detect cars using 500 images. Then, I used a motion detector system that would check and see 
            if there is motion in the driveway. If there is motion then a picture is taken. The picture is then put in the image 
            detection system to see if a car is visible. If a car is visible, then a picture is taken, the user is texted,
            and the picture is sent over text and uploaded to a folder on Google Drive.
